# ZeroDivisionError in Python Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: `ZeroDivisionError` in a function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

The `average_bug.py` file contains the buggy function. The `average_solution.py` file provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when attempting to calculate the average of an empty list, leading to division by zero.

## How to reproduce the error:

1. Run `average_bug.py` with an empty list as input.
2. Observe the `ZeroDivisionError` exception.
